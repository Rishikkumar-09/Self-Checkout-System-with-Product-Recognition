# 🛒 Self-Checkout System with Product Recognition

## 📌 Introduction
This project is a self-checkout system that uses a webcam to recognize products, retrieve their details from a CSV database, and generate an invoice. The system is built using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). This solution eliminates the need for manual barcode scanning, making the checkout process faster and more efficient.

## 🚀 Features
- 📷 **Live Webcam Feed** - Captures products in real-time, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.
- 🔍 **Product Recognition** - Uses a machine learning model to accurately identify products from a live webcam feed.
- 🛍️ **Automatic Billing** - Fetches product details (name, price, and quantity) from a CSV file and calculates the total cost.
- 📝 **Invoice Generation** - Displays scanned products along with their prices and the total bill, allowing users to review before finalizing the purchase.
- 🛑 **Start/Stop Scanning** - Users can control the scanning process, allowing flexibility in item recognition.
- 📋 **Product List Display** - Displays a structured list of scanned products for user verification.
- ⏳ **Auto Scan Every 5 Seconds** - The system continuously scans products at intervals, enhancing efficiency.
- 📊 **Error Handling & Logging** - The system detects unrecognized items and logs errors for future improvement.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface** - Built using Tkinter, providing an intuitive and interactive checkout experience.
- 📂 **CSV-Based Database** - Easy-to-update product details stored in a CSV file, eliminating the need for complex database setups.

## 📂 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/self-checkout.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd self-checkout
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Click the **Start Billing** button to begin scanning.
2. The webcam captures product images and recognizes them using a pre-trained model.
3. Product details (name, price, quantity) are retrieved from the CSV file.
4. The recognized product is displayed in the UI, updating the bill dynamically.
5. Clicking **Next** stops scanning and moves to the summary screen.
6. Users can review scanned items before proceeding to payment.
7. A final invoice is generated with all products, quantities, and the total price.
